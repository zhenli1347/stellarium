# Chinese Contemporary

## Introduction

The Chinese Contemporary Sky Culture is a combination of traditional Chinese
star names and modern constellations. This is the sky culture that the Chinese
actually use now, with a great practical value.

## Description

Contemporary Chinese use the constellations defined by the International
Astronomical Union but they combine it with their traditional starlore wherever
possible.

The 300 traditional Chinese asterisms deviate largely from the newly defined
modern areas and are no longer applicable in astronomy. However, the
traditional Chinese star names are still in common usage today, even more
common than Bayer/Flamsteed designations. They are composed of the name of the
traditional asterism plus a number.

A few stars also have proper names, such as Alpha Leonis which is called "the
Queen's Star".
