# Inuit

## Introduction

The Inuit are the indigenous peoples in the arctic areas of America, i.e.
central and northeast Canada and Greenland. Their culture is part of the
various arctic and subarctic cultures but the term "Eskimo" refers to a much
larger group (also including peoples from Alaska and on both sides of the
Behring Strait).

## Description

This sky culture for Stellarium is an adaptation of John MacDonald's research
in his book _The Arctic Sky: Inuit Astronomy, Star Lore and Legend_. While
placements and specifics of Inuit constellations might differ from tribe to
tribe, the information in Stellarium presents the constellations and general
themes of the arctic universe.
