# Sardinian

## Introduction

Sardinia is one of the two big islands west of Italy in the Mediterranian Sea
and south of the French island of Corsica.

## Description

Sardinia had been settled already by the 6th millennium BCE. In ancient times
it was visited by Phoenician traders and later occupied by the Carthaginians
and the Romans. Thus, it is incluenced by the Greek sky culture.

Nevertheless, like all peoples of the world, even the ancient Sardinians,
turned their eyes to the sky that marked the time and the seasons. The
peasant's world has given its name to the stars and the constellations of the
Sardinian culture.

The constellations of the Sardinian culture are the result of research done by
Tonino Bussu and Marco Puddu.
