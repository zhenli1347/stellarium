"### Asterisms (Xingguans)\n"
"\n"
"In traditional Chinese astronomy stars are grouped to form asterisms, known as\n"
"\"Xingguan\" (Chinese: 星官, xīngguān, meaning \"Star officials\"). Xinguuans have\n"
"names and shapes related to elements of the ancient Chinese society such as the\n"
"kingdom, the mountains, the goods or the industry. They are in a way projecting\n"
"the world of humans into the sky.\n"
"\n"
"Xingguans can contain from one to several dozens of stars. Most of them\n"
"are smaller than the constellations of Hellenistic tradition. In the Song\n"
"dynasty (13th century), the Suzhou astronomical map [#3] was engraved in\n"
"marble. It shows a total of 283 Xingguans, comprising a total of 1,565\n"
"individual stars divided into 31 regions: the 28 lunar mansions along the\n"
"ecliptic, and the 3 enclosures of the northern sky.\n"
"\n"
"![](suzhouskxt.webp)\n"
"The astronomical map of Suzhou, engraved in black marble (1247)\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"Due to precession, six Xingguans near the southern horizon became difficult to\n"
"observe and were not included in the Suzhou map. Before the Ming dynasty,\n"
"Xingguans did not include the sky around the celestial south pole. The Southern\n"
"Asterisms were added as a fifth group in the late Ming dynasty based on\n"
"European star charts, defining an additional 23 Xingguans [#11].\n"
"\n"
"### Sun, Moon and Planets\n"
"\n"
"For ancient Chinese, the Sun, the Moon and the five planets form _Seven\n"
"Luminaries_ (Chinese: 七曜, qīyào), which correspond to the Yin, the Yang and the\n"
"Five Elements. The wood is green, the fire is red, the earth is yellow, the\n"
"metal is white, the water is black. So, Mercury is named Water Star, Venus is\n"
"named Metal Star, Mars is named Fire Star, Jupiter is named Wood Star,\n"
"Saturn is named Earth Star.\n"
"\n"
"The Sun and the Moon are named Taiyang (Sun, Chinese: 太阳) and Taiyin (Moon,\n"
"Chinese: 太阴) composed from the words \"tài\" (Great, Chinese: 太) and \"Yin\" or\n"
"\"Yang\". Their other name belongs to pictographic characters Ri (Sun, Chinese:\n"
"日) and Yue (Moon, Chinese: 月) but the more commonly used name for the moon is\n"
"Yueliang (Chinese: 月亮, yuèliàng).\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"The naming of stars in ancient China is composed of the name of the Xingguan\n"
"plus a number. Some stars also have a common name, such as Alpha Leonis which\n"
"is called \"the Queen's Star\".\n"
"\n"
"Unlike Xingguans, traditional Chinese star names are still in common usage\n"
"today, even more common than Bayer/Flamsteed designations.\n"
"\n"
"### The three Enclosures\n"
"\n"
"The 3 enclosures are regions containing smaller asterisms. The enclosure of the\n"
"Purple Forbidden Palace (Chinese: 紫微垣, Zǐwēi yuán) surrounds almost the whole\n"
"circumpolar area while the enclosures of the Supreme Palace (Chinese: 太微垣,\n"
"Tàiwēi yuán) and the Heavenly Market (Chinese: 天市垣, Tiānshì yuán) are located\n"
"close to the ecliptic.\n"
"\n"
"Each enclosure has two walls, called the left wall and the right wall which are\n"
"the main Xingguans. Some Xingguans are located within these \"wall\" (such as\n"
"Guards of the Palace), others are located in the area that they are\n"
"surrounding. For example, the Xingguans of the Emperor and of the Crown Prince\n"
"are located inside the Xingguan of the Forbidden Palace.\n"
"\n"
"The enclosure of Purple Forbidden Palace [#7] represents the inner palace of\n"
"the emperor because the whole celestial sphere with all other Xingguans is\n"
"turning around this polar region. In the ancient Chinese belief, the Purple\n"
"Forbidden Palace lies in the middle of the sky and covers the modern\n"
"constellations Ursa Minor, Draco, Camelopardalis, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Auriga,\n"
"Boötes, and parts of Ursa Major, Canes Venatici, Leo Minor, Hercules. It\n"
"contains 37 traditional Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"The enclosure of the Supreme Palace [#8] is the place where the emperor and the\n"
"courtiers deal with their politics. The Supreme Palace includes a variety of\n"
"officials and government agencies, a total of 20 traditional Xingguans. It\n"
"covers the modern constellations Virgo, Coma Berenices and Leo, and parts of\n"
"Canes Venatici, Ursa Major and Leo Minor.\n"
"\n"
"Heavenly Market enclosure [#9] is a bazaar in the sky, a place where ordinary\n"
"people meet and are represented with their bazaar facilities in 19 Xingguans.\n"
"The Heavenly Market Place covers the modern constellations Serpens, Ophiuchus,\n"
"Aquila and Corona Borealis, and parts of Hercules.\n"
"\n"
"### Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions\n"
"\n"
"The 28 Lunar Mansions (Chinese: 宿, xiù) [#10] are slices of right ascensions in\n"
"the path of the Moon around the ecliptic. The lunar mansion asterisms are not\n"
"of equal size: there are 28 constellations north and south of the ecliptic but\n"
"the regions of the Xiú (mansions) extend from there towards the equatorial pole\n"
"where the right ascension lines intersect. The inital intention was to define\n"
"the mansions in a way so that the Moon changes of mansion every day but due to\n"
"variability of the orbit and speed of the Moon, this concept does not apply any\n"
"more. The smallest slice extends on only 1° of right ascension."

"### Notes on star names\n"
"\n"
"There can be more than one way of numbering the stars within one\n"
"asterism, thus, there can be more than one \"name\" for a certain star. For\n"
"example, \"the Queen's Star\" is also referred to as \"Xuanyuan 14\" or (rarely)\n"
"\"Xuanyuan 1\". The number depending on the purpose (normal astronomy or\n"
"observation of the Moon's path).\n"
"\n"
"In the traditional Chinese catalogues before 1650, coordinates were only given\n"
"for one star per constellation, the so called main star or principle star [#1].\n"
"This is the star with the number \"1\" in the constellation where counting is\n"
"started. It is usually the star with the westernmost right ascension.\n"
"\n"
"The Suzhou map [#3] is based on coordinates and asterisms defined in antiquity\n"
"which became canonical [#1],[#2] but later further stars were added. These are\n"
"called \"added stars\" (Chinese: 增星, zēng xīng) while the stars from the\n"
"original catalogue are called \"proper stars\" (Chinese: 正星, zhèng xīng).\n"
"\n"
"_The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ has 3240\n"
"Stars names in total. Yi Shitong has conducted textual research and summary of\n"
"these records in his book _Chinese and Western Contrast Star Chart and\n"
"Catalogue 1950.0_ (Chinese: 中西对照恒星图表 1950.0, Zhōngxī Duìzhào Héngxīng Túbiǎo).\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"### Notes on Lunar Mansion\n"
"\n"
"Traditional Chinese coordinates are given in \"degrees right ascension\" within a\n"
"lunar mansion. The star where the measurement starts for this lunar mansion is\n"
"called the determinative star (Chinese: 距星, jùxīng) of the mansions. The\n"
"equatorial degrees of the lodge (Chinese: 宿度, xiùdù) are all right ascensions\n"
"between the determinative star of a mansion the determinative star of the next\n"
"one. However, the traditional Chinese right ascension \"degrees\" are smaller\n"
"than in the sexagesimal system we are used to because the traditional Chinese\n"
"\"degrees\" reflect the motion of the mean Sun as one degree per day. Thus, a\n"
"Chinese \"degree\" is not 1/360 of the full circle but 1/365.25 of the circle.\n"
"\n"
"The 28 mansion asterisms are grouped into Four Holy Beasts (Chinese: 象, xiàng),\n"
"each containing seven mansions corresponding to seven luminaries. The Four Holy\n"
"Beasts are the White Tiger of the East, The Red Bird of the South, the Azure\n"
"Dragon of the West and the Dark Warrier of the North. As they all lay around\n"
"the ecliptic, the association with the compass direction does not correspond to\n"
"the real horizon.\n"

"For years, Hawaiian navigators have memorized the position of stars as they\n"
"rise and set in order to know oneʻs bearing. Wayfinder Nainoa Thompson (born\n"
"1953, Hawaii) is a graduated navigator and famous for being the first Hawaiian\n"
"to practice Polynesian art of navigation since the 14th century with a\n"
"double-hulled canoe. He developed a system of organization to help memorize the\n"
"position of stars throughout the celestial sphere by dividing the sky into four\n"
"evenly sized star lines. This system roots in ancient Hawaiian constellations\n"
"which he had got to know during his studies.\n"
"\n"
"### History\n"
"\n"
"The knowledge of Hawaiian star navigation has been passed down orally for many\n"
"generations. Much of the knowledge regarding stars and navigation were lost\n"
"until the Hawaiian Renaissance in the early 1970s. Polynesian Voyage Society\n"
"(PVS), founded in 1973, created Hokule’a in 1975. Hokule’a is a traditional\n"
"Hawaiian voyaging canoe with the mission to revive the art of way finding. A\n"
"man from Satawal, Micronesia named Mau Piailug was a master\n"
"navigator/wayfinder. The knowledge of wayfinding and using the sky to navigate\n"
"was passed down to Mau from his ancestors. Nainoa Thompson, current President\n"
"of PVS, asked Mau to teach his knowledge of navigation to him with the\n"
"intention of reviving the knowledge that was once lost to the Hawaiians. With\n"
"the knowledge learned from Mau, the Hawaiian star compass and star lines were\n"
"created.\n"
"\n"
"### Star Lines\n"
"\n"
"Each star line is a group of main stars that will be remembered by the\n"
"navigators. The stars connect making constellations. Navigators remember the\n"
"rising/setting houses of these stars, the stars that connect in each line, and\n"
"the lines that point directly to North and South. The star lines’ position in\n"
"the night sky slowly change over time, each starline being more prevalent at\n"
"night according to the season. The star lines with their according season are\n"
"as follows:\n"
"\n"
"| Native Name        | Season               |\n"
"|--------------------|----------------------|\n"
"| _Ke Ka o Makali‘i_ | November to April    |\n"
"| _Ka Iwikuamo‘o_    | April to July        |\n"
"| _Manaiakalani_     | May to October       |\n"
"| _Ka Lupe o Kawelo_ | September to February|\n"
"\n"
"### Background and Acknowledgements\n"
"\n"
"The _master navigator_ behind this sky culture was Mau Piailug of Satawal, who\n"
"taught the Polynesian art of celestial navigation to Nainoa Thompson, who\n"
"developed this version of the sky culture that was used from 2013-17 by\n"
"Hawaiians to sail around the world during the Malama Honua Voyage of Hokule’a,\n"
"the Polynesian voyaging canoe. Stellarium has been used as a tool by the\n"
"navigators of Hokule’a and this sky culture serves as a tool for practicing\n"
"Polynesian navigation."

"The Vedic sky culture shows some similiarities with the Parthian one, e.g. some\n"
"commonly known constellations related to lunar mansions, called _Nakṣatra_-s.\n"
"\n"
"### Rāśi (राशिः)\n"
"\n"
"The sidereal zodiac is an imaginary belt of 360 degrees (like the tropical\n"
"zodiac), divided into 12 equal parts. Each twelfth part (of 30 degrees) is\n"
"called a sign or rashi. Their names are shown in (brackets).\n"
"\n"
"In Vedic astronomy there are two systems of measuring time: the lunar calendar\n"
"and the solar calendar. In both cases one year is divided into 12 months or\n"
"\"māsā\". The names of the solar months originated from these constellation's\n"
"names.\n"
"\n"
"### Nakṣatra (नक्षत्रम्)\n"
"\n"
"In Hindu tradition the ecliptic is divided into 27 parts of approximately\n"
"13°20\", mirroring the siderial month and corresponding to 27 asterisms known as\n"
"the _nakṣatra_-s [#4]. In the earliest extant layers of the tradition this\n"
"number was made 28. This division is critical for several purposes including\n"
"timing rituals and determining the birth lunar mansions. Since these asterisms\n"
"define an area in the sky, technically they are also constellations.\n"
"\n"
"Surya Siddhanta and Vedanga-Jyotisha specify start coordinates for the 13°20\"\n"
"divisions using some stars [#2].\n"
"\n"
"The earliest complete lists of _nakṣatra_ are found in the _Taittirīya-śruti_\n"
"and the _Atharvaveda_ where they are recited as part of the _nakṣatreṣṭi_\n"
"ritual which places the deities of pantheon in these celestial compartments.\n"
"Some scholars opine that the tradition shows that by the early medieval period,\n"
"the _nakṣatra_ identification had changed to a small degree from the Vedic\n"
"period.\n"
"\n"
"In mythology the Nakshatras are considered to be the 27 daughters of Daksha\n"
"Prajipati and wives of Chandra, the god of moon. Daksha found that Soma\n"
"(=Chandra) overly favored one daughter (rohinī) over the others, thus\n"
"neglecting their needs and flouting his responsibilities. For this, Daksha\n"
"cursed him to wither and die. Chandra Dev approached and worshipped Lord Shiva\n"
"in order to be relieved of the curse. He gave Chandra the boon that in a lunar\n"
"month, he would grow for fifteen days (or \"Pakshā\") in one half and in the\n"
"other half he would keep losing one shade (or \"Kalā\") per lunar day (or\n"
"\"tithi\") and decrease in size.\n"
"\n"
"The names of the lunar months originated from those 12 division names in which\n"
"full moon or \"Purnimā\" occurs. Unlike a solar day which is defined by a sunrise\n"
"to next sunrise, a lunar day or moon's position in a nakshatra doesn't depends\n"
"on the Sun's or Moon's rise. Thus a lunar day may start at any time of a solar\n"
"day. Like other ancient human cultures, Vedic people invented a number of\n"
"systems for intercalation of lunar months, i.e. adding another month every 32.5\n"
"months on average or 4 months in every 11 years to correct the mismatch between\n"
"lunar and solar year.\n"

"Most astronomical observation in Japan until the Meiji Restoration was closely\n"
"tied to astrological purposes. For ancient Chinese and later Korean and\n"
"Japanese cartographers four seasons and four cardinal directions are marked as\n"
"four talismanic animals - the Azure Dragon of the East (Spring), the Red Bird\n"
"of the South (Summer), the White Tiger of the West (Fall), and the \"Genbu\"\n"
"(Black Tortoise) of the North (Winter). Corresponding to each of the talismanic\n"
"animals the celestial \"palaces\" were seven _sei shuku_ or what are sometimes\n"
"called \"lunar lodges\" or lunar mansions or lunar houses. The lunar stations\n"
"probably might be used to determine position of Sun and planets as well as the\n"
"Moon, and their number may or may not have been related to the period of the\n"
"moon's orbit. Origins of these associations are obscure and even controversial.\n"
"\n"
"Determination of the talismanic animals and associated star \"palaces\" together\n"
"with the associated 28 _sei shuku_ or lunar lodges represent some of the most\n"
"complex aspects of Asian \"astronomy\". An apparent anomaly is the fact that the\n"
"actual positional path of the sun seems to move in a direction opposite the\n"
"seasonal associations of spring and fall. Some scientists argue that this is\n"
"due to the animals and _sei shuku_ being created some 17 to 18 millennia ago\n"
"(precession creating the anomaly), but it does not really explain the apparent\n"
"\"backward\" motion of the Sun through seasons.\n"
"\n"
"According to some scientists, the talismanic animals with their associated _sei\n"
"shuku_ were probably used in conjunction with the direction to which the handle\n"
"of the Big Dipper (often called the \"Northern Seven Stars\" or \"Northern Dipper\"\n"
"in China, Korea, and Japan) pointed at the equinoxes and solstices. Before the\n"
"Christian Era, when the _sei shuku_ were created, the Big Dipper did not appear\n"
"to set, because they had a relatively \"higher\" position than now.\n"
"\n"
"Like myths and traditions in western cultures, these views still wield\n"
"influence in the daily life of people in China, Korea, and Japan (despite quite\n"
"prominent scientific literacy). However, it should be pointed out that\n"
"astrological divination in China, Korea and Japan was and is rather complex.\n"
"\n"
"The lore related to lunar mansions is one of the most interesting aspects of\n"
"Asian ethnoastronomy. Japanese interpretations of these associations tended to\n"
"revolve around agricultural needs and animistic views of nature. Unlike many\n"
"western myths and traditions, Japanese gods in the similitude of the talismanic\n"
"animals can be seen as manifestations of nature.\n"

"### Origin\n"
"\n"
"The 272 constellations displayed in this Stellarium sky culture are based on\n"
"the _Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Zi-Do_, the Korean Constellation map, which was\n"
"carved in stone 1395. The black stone plate was 122.5 cm in width, 211 cm in\n"
"height, and 12 cm in depth; the stars were highlighted in white. The map\n"
"displays 1,467 stars [#1], 264 constellations and their names, the ecliptic and\n"
"equatorial lines, and the 365 Chinese \"degrees\" of the full circle. It was\n"
"compiled as a copy of earlier Korean map (Goguryeo star map) of Chinese roots\n"
"and changed in details due to recent observations. Therefore, some stars are\n"
"engraved at their coordinates up to a millennium earlier and for some (groups\n"
"of) stars precession is applied.\n"
"\n"
"The interpretation of the map is not easy: the map is so old that only about\n"
"300 stars are found to match with the real stars. All the stars of the map were\n"
"drawn on a circle, so the equator seems smaller than the southern limit.\n"
"Because the density of constellation does not change with respect to the\n"
"position, the position and the size of the constellations were somewhat altered\n"
"in a way unknown by the author. It is assumed that there should be no bright\n"
"stars which do not belong to any constellations. The work of the author is\n"
"subject to interpretation, and could be changed at a later time. It will\n"
"however roughly show what the Korean Constellation are like.\n"
"\n"
"The origin of this Korean celestial map is another sky map which existed about\n"
"2,000 years ago, the Chinese Suzhou map (cf: Chinese sky culture). The original\n"
"Korean map grouped the 1467 stars in about 190 constellations. The shapes of\n"
"the depictions are slightly different from the Chinese ones."

"Mongolian are nomads living on a large territory of central Asia. Their culture\n"

"Babylonian, Greek) cultures."
msgstr ""

# Sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"Mongolian constellations and cosmogony were inherited from the occidental\n"
"civilisation notably by the contact with Alexander the Great whose scholars\n"
"considered Babylonian astral science as highest standard. It was also largely\n"
"influenced by Chinese civilisation and Buddhist religion, resulting in numerous\n"
"myths and beliefs linked with what surrounds them. The local wild and fauna are\n"
"the main themes of this sky culture. The wealth of their cosmogony is probably\n"
"to link with the excellent observing conditions for whom they benefit even now.\n"
"In the past, the necessity for Mogolians to move and to get one's bearing even\n"
"during the night and at different seasons, is probably one of the elements\n"
"which developed their imagination facing the sky.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is\n"
"symbolized by the golden stick (_Altan Hadaas_). Almost all Mongolian asterisms\n"
"are similar to the modern ones but some of them have different names, e.g.: the\n"
"Swan is named _Num Sum_ (The Bow and the Arrow) and the Big Dipper is called\n"
"_Doloon Burkhan_. In the Mongolian imagination, the stars of the summer\n"
"triangle, i.e. Vega, Deneb and Altair, refer to three stags (_Gurvan Maral Od_\n"
"inMongolian) and Cassiopeia represents the Five Stars Woman (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
"Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculated the positions of each of the\n"
"five naked eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn): planets beyond\n"
"Saturn were not recognized in the pre-telescopic era.\n"
"\n"
"Like in Roman culture, the Mongolians attributed the five planets to each day\n"
"of the week, completing the seven days week with the Sun (_Nar_) for Sunday and\n"
"the Moon(_Sar_) for Monday. The names of the solar system's planets have some\n"
"peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named _Bud_ (associated with Wednesday),\n"
"Venus, _Sugar_ (associated with Friday), the Earth, _Delkhii_, Mars, _Angarag_\n"
"(associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, _Barhasbadi_ (associated with Thursday),\n"
"Saturn, _Sanchir_ (associated with Saturday). The term for Uranus is\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_ and for Neptune _Dalai-van_. We can see that the two last,\n"
"invisible to the naked eye, and discovered long time after the others, have the\n"
"characteristics to have the particle _-van_ at the end of the name, indicating\n"
"the princely status in Mongolian. The Earth does not have this particle in the\n"
"name but dwarf planet Pluto (_Dalkhii-van_ in Mongolian) has a very similiar\n"
"designation and includes this particle. It is possible to translate Pluto'\n"
"Mongolian name as \"The princely ground\"; it is something like earth but not the\n"
"Earth (planet) but the ground/ surface on which we walk. Uranus,\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_, could be translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptun,\n"
"_Dalai-van_, as the \"princely ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real\n"
"equivalent in English, and translations above are presented to give an idea of\n"
"the planets name's meaning. These names come from Sanskrit (language spoken in\n"
"India) and are largely used in the current language in Mongolia but in an\n"
"unofficial way.\n"
"\n"
"It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating\n"
"other celestial bodies and their beliefs: Indeed, the Milky Way is named\n"
"_Tengeriin Zadas_ which could literally be translated as the Sky Line\n"
"(_Tengeriin_, the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and _Zadas_, the\n"
"line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the star located above\n"
"Mizar in the Great Bear. It symbolises the recovery and protection star. It was\n"
"placed here by _Tengeriin_ (god of heaven) to protect Mizar. To become an\n"
"archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it seemed that one had to be able to\n"
"discern these two stars with the naked eye.\n"
"\n"
"From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes back to\n"
"_Ulug Beg_ (AD 1394-1449; _Taraghay_ by his real name), astronomer,\n"
"mathematician and vice-king in Samarkand. His empire extended to Central Asia.\n"
"Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies and\n"
"astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely precisely\n"
"measure Saturn's revolution period (_Sanchir_) with a sextant of 40 meters\n"
"radius.\n"
"\n"
"### Myths and Legends\n"
"\n"
"#### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
"Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation is\n"
"limited for them to the seven stars of the Dipper forming the bear's tail and\n"
"body, and the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding\n"
"> capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it\n"
"> peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked\n"
"> the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to\n"
"> rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went\n"
"> together to assist their queen. For two days and three nights they searched\n"
"> for the monster. Then, in the middle of the third night, they found and\n"
"> killed it. They brought back the queen in the castle.\n"
">\n"
"> The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to throw it to\n"
"> the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The youngest brother succeeded\n"
"> and changed immediately into the North Star. The seven others changed into\n"
"> the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting their younger brother every night.\n"
"> The name _Doloonburkhan_ (the Seven Buddhas) comes from this legend to\n"
"> appoint the Great Bear and the Golden Stick, _Altan Hadaas_, the Polar Star.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian\n"
"people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to\n"
"every Mongolian depending on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. Chinese\n"
"and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian calendar is a\n"
"lunar calendar). Each year is related to an animal and is associated with a\n"
"star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe (alpha UMa), corresponds\n"
"to the rat's year, the second, Merak (beta UMa), corresponds to the year of the\n"
"ox and so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the\n"
"year of the horse. Then we start again at the first star in the year of the\n"
"sheep and we repeat the same way until the twelfth and last year of the Chinese\n"
"calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the tail\n"
"are assigned one time only.\n"
"\n"
"This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described by _Elverskog_. There\n"
"however, the association of the stars goes in an up-and-down movement, i.e.,\n"
"Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox,... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
"Shooting stars have also a specific meaning for Mongolians: they are\n"
"personified through their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they\n"
"imagine that it is a star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes\n"
"somebody who just died. Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say:\n"
"\"Phew, it is not me!\" (which is also a common belief among nomadic people of\n"
"the West Sahara and some Arabic tribes).\n"
"\n"
"#### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
"Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and _Hun Tavan\n"
"Od_ (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost forgotten by\n"
"most Mongolians:\n"
"\n"
"##### Sun\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly dry\n"
"> meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very good\n"
"> archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns without\n"
"> missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself all the\n"
"> fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot (groundhog) to\n"
"> ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first\n"
"> arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed\n"
"> the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when\n"
"> a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird was hit. The man\n"
"> had not reached his goal, so he left towards exile in a hole, cut his fingers\n"
"> and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved our Sun, otherwise all\n"
"> life would have disappeared from the world's surface.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the\n"
"Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist\n"
"religion.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At that time, there lived a scary monster named _Raah_ which frightened the\n"
"> entire world. He devoured all what were in its way. The god _Orchiwaani_\n"
"> owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, _Raah_\n"
"> stole the magic spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in\n"
"> the act and reported to _Orchiwaani_. Seething with rage to hear about this\n"
"> piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but it\n"
"> grew again immediately because _Raah_ had become immortal. Then, he intended\n"
"> to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again directly.\n"
"> Just as _Orchiwaani_ had seized the monster to finish it off, it escaped and\n"
"> disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then _Orchiwaani_ asked the Moon to\n"
"> help, who recaptured _Raah_ and cut its rump and its tail. In revenge, the\n"
"> monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun but they always\n"
"> immediately exit it. This is the mythological reason for lunar and solar\n"
"> eclipses.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that _Raah_ devours the\n"
"Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise in order to make the monster to\n"
"liberate the eclipsed one. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck wrote [#1]:\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Some \\[Mongolian people\\] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them \\[to\n"
"> other Mongolian people\\] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about to\n"
"> produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the door of\n"
"> their habitation. And while the eclipse happens, they play the drum and\n"
"> instruments and make big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, they\n"
"> devote themselves to beverage and festivity and make a big party.\"\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their\n"
"tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for the\n"
"tourists. Also note the similarity of _Raah_ with Indian _Rahu_.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for the\n"
"Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five children\n"
"of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. Their\n"
"> mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to untie a\n"
"> knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united with other,\n"
"> and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. Conversely, if the knots\n"
"> withstood the test, the five brothers would remain united and close for the\n"
"> rest of their lives and would be victorious at the time of wars.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one hundred\n"
"stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (_Doloon Burkhan_) by throwing milk\n"
"in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. They\n"
"pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not for just\n"
"one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced by vodka\n"
"which, due to its colorlessness, symbolizes the dark color and the strength for\n"
"Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear and fends off\n"
"evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian\n"
"cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs which\n"
"are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission is\n"
"essentially verbal, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. It is\n"
"therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high fidelity and\n"
"precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, every\n"
"observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"
"\n"

"Romania is a land in southeast Europe. Romanian popular stellar mythology is a\n"
"mixture of several historical epochs from pre-Christian to modern."

# Sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"Considered as a whole, Romanian popular stellar mythology has three essential\n"
"components:\n"
"\n"
"1. The ancestral pastoral-agricultural culture: in this pre-Christian culture,\n"
"the sky is seen both as an agrarian clock for specific activities and as an\n"
"\"exhibition\" of agricultural tools used by peasants.\n"
"\n"
"2. More recently, corresponding to the Christianization of Romanian\n"
"geographical space, there was also a repositioning in the sky: Christian and\n"
"pre-Christian elements and constellations are associated with cosmogonical and\n"
"theogonical myths, so that the sky is seen more like a church.\n"
"\n"
"3. The origin of the Romanian people: historical scenes from the conquest of\n"
"Dacia by the Romans are projected in the sky.\n"
"\n"
"One of the differences between the Romanian and the modern sky culture is in\n"
"the constellation of Orion, the Hunter. There are four traditional Romanian\n"
"constellations overlapping in this modern constellation area.\n"

# Sky culture description section in markdown format

"Sami constellations can be observed on Sami artifacts connected to the old\n"
"religion, suggesting that the night sky played an important cultural role for\n"
"them. The Sami sky culture has a lot in common with other arctic and sub-arctic\n"
"cultures in Eurasia. One unfortunate similarity is that much of the culture was\n"
"lost before it was recorded properly.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture is a conglomeration of at least three slightly different\n"
"cultures from the people of the South-Sami, North-Sami and Russian Sami. Each\n"
"of these groups have slightly different languages and as such there may be\n"
"small differences with some references [#1][#2].\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium's Sami sky culture is based on the work of Bo Lundmark _Bæi'vi mánno\n"
"nástit_ [#3], who based much of his work on the writings of the Sami artist and\n"
"author Johan Turi.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations and Stars\n"
"\n"
"The Sami constellations are probably very old but were recorded in writing\n"
"during the 19th century. It is unclear if the written record is complete. The\n"
"constellations and stars included here are all connected to the dominant\n"
"constellation, _Sarva_ — the elk. Sarva is the Sami name for elk, an\n"
"alternative name is _Sarvvis_ — Bull elk. The origin of this constellation\n"
"probably dates back to the old hunter culture before reindeer were\n"
"domesticated.\n"
"\n"
"_Sarva_ consists of the modern constellations Cassiopeia, Perseus and parts of\n"
"Auriga. Constellations and stars surrounding Sarva represent hunters of the\n"
"elk. _Favdna_ (also transcribed as _Favtna_) is the star Arcturus, and\n"
"represents the Hunter who aims at the elk with his bow and arrow (_Fauna\n"
"davgge_ — the Big Dipper). _Favdna_ must aim well, for if he hits\n"
"_Boahjenaste_, the Sky Support (the star Polaris), legend has it that the world\n"
"will come to an end.\n"
"\n"
"_Favdna_ has a number of helpers: _Galla_ (Procyon) and his sons _Gallabarneck_\n"
"(Orion's belt), the \"Ski Runners\", _Cuoigahægjek_ (Castor and Pollux) and \"The\n"
"Runner\" (Vega). The Pleiades are called _Rougot_ (dog pack) or _Miese-cora_\n"
"(calfpack). The identification of Procyon with _Galla_ is not certain: It could\n"
"be Procyon, Rigel, or Sirius - we suggest Procyon as _Galla_ in this sky\n"
"culture because Sirius is very hard to spot from the latitude where the Sami\n"
"live.\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is called _Lodde-raiddaras_ (lit. bird path) or _Jakke-mærka_\n"
"(lit. year mark). The name used depends on the season. In the sky chart of\n"
"Johan Turi, one can observe a star _Guovso-naste_, morning star, that can be\n"
"identified as Venus, but this is not certain as it can also be identified as\n"
"Altair, a star showing the morning is approaching (similar to Arcturus in the\n"
"Norse sky culture).\n"
"\n"
"The Sami sky culture does not have a large number of constellations. This is\n"
"thought to be mainly because of the high Northerly latitude of the Sami\n"
"people's range. Two factors contribute to this: that the Southern sky stays\n"
"below the horizon to a large extent, and that the Aurora Borealis is frequently\n"
"bright enough to obscure many stars."

"The names of the constellations of the native Siberian peoples and tribes is\n"
"poorly studied. Additonally, due to the large territory, the knowledge about\n"
"constellations is difficult to reconcile in a single integrated picture. In\n"

"\n"
"The names of the Milky Way are quite numerous, but they can be distinguished\n"
"into two groups: (i) the names coming from the past (e.g., _Goose Road_) and\n"

"The Pleiades have many names, even more than names for the Milky Way exist.\n"

"Whilst the most-notable/common stars and constellations (i.e. Orion, Pleiades,\n"
"Crux) are identified in Tongan star lore there are two notable exceptions.\n"
"There is an absence of naming of the North star (Polaris: α UMi). This is\n"
"peculiar considering the latitude of the Tongan islands and the prominence of\n"
"this star at certain times of the year. In the event of any northerly journeys\n"
"from Tonga such an important navigational landmark could not have possibly gone\n"
"unnoticed. The constellation of Scorpio (parts in, or stars of) are also absent\n"
"from Tongan star lore. This is surprising since the vast majority of star lore\n"
"– globally and Polynesian – has Scorpio as a central constellation due to it\n"
"being easily identified and that it is nearly directly opposite Orion in the\n"
"night sky. Stellarium team would welcome any further knowledge on these two\n"
"anomalies.\n"
"\n"
"Common ancestry of Polynesian star lore's is evident in the similarities in the\n"
"naming of stars. For example the Pleiades is called _Mataliki_ in Tongan,\n"
"_Matariki_ in Maori and _Makali'i_ in Hawaiian.\n"
"\n"
"In some circumstances separation of individual star names from \"star path\"\n"
"names cannot be resolved. A star may have multiple names 1) if the star is part\n"
"of numerous star paths and 2) since the naming of stars can differ depending on\n"
"which Tongan island group it originates from. The nomenclature of stars is\n"
"approximated based on the limited resources available."

"### Tukano Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Constellations within Tukano astronomical culture are related with natural\n"
"phenomena as a whole. We gathered twelve constellations with a group who speaks\n"
"Tukano language. This is not the definitive number of constellations. There\n"
"are, surely, more constellations to be described. We presented here essentially\n"
"\"the main cycle\" [#2] of the Tukano constellations. Sometimes someone relates\n"
"new discoveries about these Indians sky concepts or presents new constellation\n"
"descriptions. Though we are establishing limits and configurations to these\n"
"constellations that are new to us (non- Indians), they don’t organize this body\n"
"of knowledge in the same way. Their conceptions about sky and Universe are\n"
"different when compared with ours. They don’t organize and conceive ideas about\n"
"the Universe as a whole, like us.\n"
"\n"
"Hereby we present few data from a research carried out with living people and\n"
"this data may be variable in near future. We worked with basic school students,\n"
"elders and story tellers comparing the talks and summarizing it as you’ll see\n"
"below.\n"
"\n"
"In general, we can say that a Tukano constellation, or parts of it, are\n"
"observed when its setting occurs, like the sunset (heliacal setting) during the\n"
"short period of an year. There are an amount of natural phenomena related to\n"
"this astronomical event. For example we can consider Aña’s head setting during\n"
"November and its relation with the increase and decrease of the Tiquié river\n"
"level. The variation of the river level is accompanied with an emerging of\n"
"different fishes which appear as the result of these changeable natural\n"
"conditions. Other larger fishes follow the first group for multiple purposes\n"
"(eating smaller ones for example). All of them eat some fruits which eventually\n"
"fall over the river surface. Ground animals and microorganisms are interested\n"
"on these fruits, as well as either. So, a phenomenon first described as an\n"
"astronomical set for us can be seen inside a more complex behavior for Tukanos\n"
"and their neighbors around this region. Animals, plants and also spiritual\n"
"manifestations are in a complex relationship under the cosmological view that\n"
"we can’t ignore anymore.\n"
"\n"
"### Sources\n"
"\n"
"This work is part of an amount of researches developed as a survey, conducted\n"
"between 2005 and 2007 that resulted in a doctoral/PhD thesis (Cardoso, 2007).\n"
"Relying on Ethnomatematics sources (D’ambrosio, 2002), in practical sky\n"
"observation activities and on classical sources about constellations observed\n"
"in Brazil’s Amazon region, we accomplished a sky mapping of these Indian\n"
"ethnicity: Tukano, Dessano and Tuyuka but in particular, the first one. From\n"
"the description of many constellations we created an astronomical events and\n"
"climate calendar along with students from differentiated Yupuri’s indigenous\n"
"school. Rain periods, drought, planting and harvesting are marked by the sunset\n"
"and sunrise of the major constellations created by Amazonia northwest Indians."

"The Western sky culture divides the celestial sphere into 88 areas of various\n"

"International Astronomical Union in 1922. These constellations have become the\n"
"standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets in other sky cultures\n"

"\n"
"The constellations in use today are based mainly on ancient Greek\n"
"constellations depicted by Ptolemy in his book the _Almagest_ during the 2nd\n"
"century CE. In the subsequent centuries, this book has been translated from\n"
"Greek into Arabic (6th to 9th century) and later to medieval Latin. In the\n"
"Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, the Ptolemaic figures were enriched\n"
"and transformed by native Arabic constellations and star names.\n"
"\n"
"In the 18th century, European astronomers suggested new constellations to fill\n"
"the gaps between northern constellations (e.g. the constellation of \"the lynx\"\n"
"for an area close to the Great Bear but with stars so faint that you would need\n"
"the eyes of a lynx to see them) and also created new constellations in the\n"
"southern part of the sky which had not been visible to Ptolemy. These new\n"
"constellations were usually named after new technical inventions of the early\n"
"modern period (e.g. a chemical machine, a balloon, an air pump) or exotic\n"
"animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise bird). Among them many\n"
"constellations were also named with political consideration to honor certain\n"
"kings or patrons.\n"
"\n"
"In the beginning of the 20th century, the IAU (International Astronomical\n"
"Union) aimed for a large clean-up: in 1922, it officially accepted the list of\n"
"88 constellation names. In 1928 it also defined precise constellation\n"
"boundaries [#1] still in use today."

# Sky culture extras section in markdown format

"In the 2nd century CE, Ptolemy in Alexandria published a multi-volume book\n"
"which summarised the knowledge of the time, rooted in a tradition of\n"
"mathematical astronomy since Hipparchus (at least 265 year earlier). In the\n"
"subsequent centuries, this book has been translated from Greek into Arabic (6th\n"
"to 9th century), from Arabic into Latin, and later, from the original ancient\n"
"Greek into medieval Latin. Due to this transformation, it is now known under\n"
"the artificial name _Almagest_, derived from the Arabic title [#7].\n"
"\n"
"The Almagest's star catalogue (book VII and VIII) has been depicted many times\n"
"in the Islamic as well as in the Christian astronomical traditions. Often, the\n"
"figures were re-drawn in order to adapt them to the taste of art of the epoch.\n"
"In the Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, the Ptolemaic figures were\n"
"enriched and transformed by native Arabic constellations and star names.\n"
"Therefore, this sky culture displays a modern descendant of the Ptolemaic one\n"
"with traces of translations, misunderstandings, transformations, and purposly\n"
"additions.\n"
"\n"
"In 1603 the lawyer and hobby astronomer Johann Bayer from Augsburg, Germany,\n"
"made a new celestial atlas, called Uranometria [#2]. In this atlas, he\n"
"introduced a systematic naming of stars starting with alpha, the brightest,\n"
"beta, the second brightest, gamma, the third ... within a constellation.\n"
"Subsequently, it was established to name a star with a Greek letter and the\n"
"Latin constellation name in casus genitive.\n"
"\n"
"In the 18th century, the century of great atlases (Flamsteed, Fortin, Bode:\n"
"[#3][#4]), new constellations were added to fill the gaps between northern\n"
"constellations. Additionally, there were suggestions to create new\n"
"constellations in the southern part of the sky which had not been visible to\n"
"Ptolemy. European astronomers visited the European colonies and instead of\n"
"asking the native people for their constellations, the Europeans were creative.\n"
"This way, many new technical inventions of the early modern period were\n"
"depicted in constellations (e.g. a chemical machine, a balloon, an air pump) as\n"
"well as exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise bird).\n"
"\n"
"The problem was that sometimes astronomers did not agree with each other and,\n"
"thus, atlases showed deviations from each other.\n"
"\n"
"After many centuries of astronomers taking liberties in interpretation of the\n"
"Ptolemaic original, there were many variants of constellations. As\n"
"constellations are a positioning system, i.e. astronomers describe positions in\n"
"the sky relative to stars and stars relative to constellations (like\n"
"\"Betelgeuse\", Orion's right shoulder), it is necessary to use constellation\n"
"names and star names uniformly all over the world.\n"
"\n"
"In the \"Fin de siècle\", there were upcoming suggestions in the IAU to unify the\n"
"system of constellations and star names [#5].\n"
"\n"
"As the IAU in 1928 only defined the boundaries of these areas [#4] and not the\n"
"way of drawing artwork within them, several sub-cultures of painting figures\n"
"and drawing simplified stickfigures were developed during the 20th and 21st\n"
"century. We provide some of them as further sky cultures.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"These constellations are based mainly on the Ptolemaic tradition which had been\n"
"used in all three Abrahamitic religions and, thus, was common in the Near East,\n"
"in Europe and its colonies on all continents. However, between the ancient\n"
"Greek constellations there were gaps of areas with only faint stars belonging\n"
"to no constellation.[#8] In the Modern Epoch, several astronomers suggested\n"
"constellation figures for these gaps (e.g. the constellation of \"the lynx\" for\n"
"an area close to the Great Bear but with stars so faint that you would need the\n"
"eyes of a lynx to see them), among them many political constellations to the\n"
"honor of certain kings or patrons. In the beginning of the 20th century, the\n"
"IAU aimed for a huge clean-up.\n"
"\n"
"In 1922, the IAU officially accepted the list of 88 constellation names and\n"
"their official abbreviations with three letters. The only remaining political\n"
"constellations is Scutum, the shield of a Polish king but without mentioning\n"
"the political reference anymore. The Belgian priest E. Delporte got the task to\n"
"define constellation boundaries according to coordinates. In 1928, he finished\n"
"the work and the IAU accepted his delimitations [#1].\n"
"\n"
"These \"constellations\" are naked areas in the sky without any stick figures or\n"
"depictions [#5]. The borders simply follow the lines of right ascension and\n"
"declination. These constellations became the standard way to describe the sky,\n"
"replacing similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium by default displays the precise RA-DEC-boundaries and a set of\n"
"artwork constellations on the basis of Ptolemaic figures but following our\n"
"contemporary taste of art.\n"
"\n"
"### Proper names of stars\n"
"\n"
"Ptolemy's star catalogue had the layout of a table listing the description of\n"
"the star's position in the constellation's figure, the ecliptical coordinates,\n"
"and the magnitude e.g.: \"The star at the tip of the tail of Ursa Minor\", \"Gem 0\n"
"1/6, +66\", \"Mag 3\".\n"
"\n"
"In most cases, the star names evolved by astronomer's systematical\n"
"abbreviations of these descriptions, e.g. first astronomer abbreviated in a\n"
"text \"tip of the tail\", a next astronomer drew a map with less space and wrote\n"
"only \"tail\" next to the star and this name remained. With centuries, these\n"
"descriptions were translated into Arabic and Latin, and in some cases the\n"
"translators or writers make mistakes because of misreading or misspelling or\n"
"the Arabic words (e.g. the Arabic \"yad al gauza\", the hand of the giant woman,\n"
"to the common term \"Betelgeuse\").\n"
"\n"
"However, there are also a few original Greek words like the red star \"Antares\",\n"
"the counterpart of Ares (Mars) and even a few original Babylonian terms like\n"
"\"Shargaz\", the Sting, in Scorpius. Our modern, most recent IAU star names [#6]\n"
"are a huge mixture, also with influences or even politically wanted additions\n"
"of star names from the none-Ptolemaic sky cultures, e.g. the traditional\n"
"Pingsing, a Chinese star name for a star in Hydra (its meaning is only \"star\",\n"
"a reminescence to his lonely position) or newly adopted star names from\n"
"Polynesian, Hawaiian, or Aboriginal cultures for names of stars with\n"
"exoplanets."

"constellation figures. Rey's work does not include figurative artwork,\n"
"therefore this sky culture deliberately only comes with Rey's original stick\n"
"figures. The constellation names were also always given in English by Rey. If\n"
"you switch to \"Native\" name display mode, you may see exactly the spelling used\n"
"in his book. Also the stars named here are limited to those included in the\n"
"book.\n"

"### Rey's Figures and the Classic Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Rey's constellations adhere to the tradition of the Western sky culture and\n"
"describes the 88 officially acknowledged constellations, with addition of\n"
"asterisms of the two Dippers and the \"Great Square\" (of Pegasus). However, at\n"
"several points Rey's figures deviate from the canonical figures described since\n"
"Ptolemy's Almagest (2nd century AD), where also positions of the stars in their\n"
"constellations had been described in their names. For example:\n"
"\n"
" * Rey inverted the figure of the Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) to look like a polar\n"
"bear scenting prey. This on one hand does not have the usual problem to explain\n"
"its long tail. On the other hand, the bear is not shown to walk around the pole\n"
"in this orientation.\n"
"\n"
" * The Bull (_Taurus_), only the front of which is shown with long upright horns\n"
"in usual depictions, is shown with a complete body including its tail, with\n"
"horns stretched wide like those of a buffalo. Its bright eye _Aldebaran_ now\n"
"lies in its neck.\n"
"\n"
" * The head of _Hercules_ is usually next to the head of _Ophiuchus_, the\n"
"serpent holder, and the four stars known as \"keystone\" form his body. Rey makes\n"
"his head out of the keystone, and the star that usually marks the hero's head\n"
"is now one of his feet.\n"
"\n"
" * The Whale (_Cetus_) has been turned around, its formermouth now forming a\n"
"tail fin.\n"
"\n"
" * _Pegasus_ exchanged feet and head.\n"
"\n"
" * _Bootes_, the herdsman, is shown sitting and smoking a pipe (no trace of\n"
"political correctness in a children's book of the 1950s!)"
